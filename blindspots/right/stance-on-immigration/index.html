					<h2>Immigration here?</h2>
					<p>One of the biggest political topics there is on the political stage is Immagration. The Left tends to believe in more acceptance from immigrants around the world, and the right tends to be really much more conservative on its borders. It's really easy to understand both sides. On the left, you want to accept more people in the US and allow them to live a possibly better life. However, on the right you tend to believe that allowing more people in could and may cause more crime or more unsafety. One of the big problems with the right is that they don't tend to understand how difficult it is to become a US citizen if you aren't coming to the US for asylum, even then the process is very difficult.</p>
                    <p>The US can be seen as one of the greatest countries in the world. One of the main reasons is because of the liberties it gives its people. In many other countries around the world, there isn't space for free thinking, or the ability to marry who you'd like to marry. The French would write, “Give me your tired, your poor, Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, The wretched refuse of your teeming shore.” on the statue of liberty. Though this was not originally made as a symbol of freedom, it was over the years made to be exactly that. People held with pride that the US would take in those people who needed help and wanted a better life for themselves and their families.</p>
                    
                    <h2>Why the sudden change?</h2>
                    <p>After all, we still own the Statue of Liberty and still contain the quote that states that we would accept those people. People on the Conservative side of the political spectrum believe that the quote of allowing the poor and the weak to come to the US was starting to wear down when people would come into the US and create crimes. Now, to point out, and this is very important, not everyone that comes through the US borders is bad. As a matter of fact, we believe that the majority of the people who come to the US truly do come here to seek a better life. But the right still tends to believe that our borders should be closed. They claim to want more safety, and they say people should come into the US legally that way they know who is coming into the US.</p>
                    <p>The problem starts exactly there. People who want to come into the US have to go through a process that can last up to a decade. Furthermore, there isnt any clear line to get into the US. Most of the time its “chance-like”. There's some chance that you might get into the US, but there isn't any guarantee on becoming a legal resident. At the same time, if you are applying for citizenship and you come from high immigration countries, you have a lower chance of being able to become a US citizen. To add on, if the person applying to become a US citizen is fleeing from any sort of danger, while going through the process of becoming a legal citizen, the person isn't provided with any humanitarian relief. Instead they have to take care of themselves and they have to support themselves without help from the US government, or even their own.</p>

                    <h2>In conclusion</h2>
                    <p>The process of becoming a citizen in the US is very worksome and extremely difficult. While some of the concerns of the right may be reasonable and justifiable, there isn’t any doubt that the US government should try and fix or upgrade their immagration systems. It's important to think about what the person is going through and that the process sint easy. Putting yourself in someone's shoes can help you, to some extent, walk in their world. </p>
