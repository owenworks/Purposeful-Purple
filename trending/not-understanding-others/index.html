					<h2>Hello friend?</h2>
					<p>It has come to my attention that when people tend to debate one another, the opposing side tends to bring up arguments that others haven't made. There’s times where it’s reasonable or maybe justifiable that people argue against non-existing view points as the media can have biases and tamper with the truth. And it's no surprise that the media has biases, they need to be able to attract people who want to hear what they like to hear. However, this consequently leads to people having wrong ideas about the opposing side, or even wrong ideas of policies they think they themselves would support. </p>
                    <p>A 2018 study from PennState College of the Liberal Arts proves that many people show much hatred towards their rival political group without having an idea as to why. It's very common for people to dislike one another for having radical opposing ideas, or morals, though it's very concerning when disliking one another arises when there is no clear reason for why. To start off, if Americans are debating ideas that the other side of the political aisle has never made, then it will create this chaotic society. </p>
                    
                    <h2>More then what meets the eye</h2>
                    <p>Humans are already made for judging, they do it involuntarily and they do it for good reason. The human body is developed in a way that allows for us to take in information from around us (our surroundings and environment) and have a unique output for every new piece of information. We then are able to create predictions based on previous knowledge and we are able to create judgments of certain things, places, or people. But imagine we made predictions or inferences using knowledge that we don't know is true. Ideas we don't know are factual and reliable. This would create disorder, because we are now going based off of the unknown. Going off of the unknown can at times be reasonable such as the creation of a hypothesis in your science class. However, when we judge people based on things we believe to be true but in reality are blatantly false, it could cause major damage. We now have the image and reputation of those people in our hands, and when we throw names out such as “rasict” or “homophobic”, it can change the way people think of that person, or in this case, a group.</p>
                    <p>The study that was alluded to earlier done by the PennState College of the Liberal Arts showed that democrats and republicans could not present reasons for why the other side would vote as they did. In the survey taken, many Republicans stated that Democrat voters were voting as they were in order to achieve “free stuff” such as free healthcare, or free college. However, when the Democrat voters were asked why they voted blue, their reasoning was usually never for “free stuff”. Republicans have labeled Democrats as people who don't want to work for their gain and want to be handed free benefits. Due to Republicans rolling with this idea, it creates little to no ground for communication. People tend not to sit down with someone who has out of this world ideas, which would mean that in this context, Conservatives wouldn't want to rationalize with Liberals due to a label that was wrongly given out.</p>
                    <p>This doesn't only apply to Red voters however. In the same study, it was found that Democrats believed that the reason those who voted the way they did was because they wanted to be “racist” or because “Fox news” told them to do so. This is far from the truth but it is a very common idea amongst liberal voters. They have the same consequential problem as conservatives; if you pursue fake generalizations about a certain group of people, you won't be able to sit down with them and have civil discussions about the country. If we aren't able to sit down with curiosity relating to why the opposing wing thinks the way they do, we won't be able to find common ground in order to solve real world problems.</p>

                    <h2>In conclusion</h2>
                    <p>To conclude, it's very important for us to take the time to realize that there are contrary beliefs. Upon doing so, we also need to realize and take in notice that all we think we know, we might not know, and from there, we should have the courage to search for those missing answers. We as a society and as a nation, don't necessarily need to come to a whole mutual agreement as to what is wrong or right, but we at least need to be able to back out arguments against our political opponents with evidence and not out of the nowhere statements. By doing so, we here at Purposeful Purple believe that we can better ourselves and our own nation to become a place where ideas are able to be expressed with mutual communication.</p>
