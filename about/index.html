					<h2>Introduction</h2>
					<p>During my 8th grade year at Simpson Middle School, I had been attracting people by doing impressive scholarly moves. One of the most attention grabbing moments I did was running for Student Council President. I won the election, but it was followed by more people knowing my name, and myself being known as an accomplished individual.</p>
					<p>However, it was that same year that I noticed that politics had a big impact on people, no, not in a good way. At the start of quarantine in 2020, I made the discovery that I was not as stable in my self-identified political group as I thought. As a result, I made a switch that would consequently end my popularity.</p>
					<p>During the lockdown, awareness for social justice had taken the media by storm, and for a good cause, to end racism, and social injustice. It was at this time, I decided Twitter would be a great idea for my entertainment, and to better understand the conflict. Upon installing one of the most well known apps, I wasn't only being entertained by what I didn't wanted to see, but I was shocked to see that people were bashing one another for having different stances. To elaborate, many people thought that the only ones opposing an idea were racist, bigotted, extremist. This is such an unfair representation, and you'd be surprised that there was lots of individuals that was against such organizations, or means of bringing awareness that do not fit that description.</p>
					<p>I was sad to see that people would go to extreme lengths to “degrade” any of those who oppose others' ideas, or policies, even if that individual has a lot of the same beliefs.</p>
					
					<h2>A new project is born</h2>
					<p>It is for this reason, (and later to be found many more), that I wanted a change in how we ran society. Would we continue to kill each other over statements that we opposed, or would we come together in civility and have conversations that made western civilization what it is? Would we be able to sit across the table with a not-so-radical right leaning uncle, or with a not-so-radical left leaning sister in order to discuss and share ideas that can make America a great country? Would a kid be able to have a high position in school and be applauded if he had different political views than the majority? In my reasoning, I would say no. Not unless we find the roots of our ideas and are able to share them freely without being bashed and prosecuted for them. That's why Purposeful Purple was made. In order to awaken people and remind them that having different political views shouldn't stop you from accepting people into your life.</p>
