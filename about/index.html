				<section class="post-full-content">
					<p>During my 8th grade year at Simpson Middle School, I had been attracting people by doing impressive scholarly moves. One of the most attention grabbing moments I did was running for Student Council President. I won the election, but it was followed by more people knowing my name, and myself being known as an accomplished individual. However, it was that same year that I noticed that politics had a big impact on people, no, not in a good way. When COVID hit and we were at the start of quarantine I made some discoveries that maybe I wasn't as stable in my self-identified political group as I thought I was. I made a switch that would consequently end my popularity. </p><p>During these times, the BLM movement was gaining momentum at a fast speed. It was also during these times that I decided Twitter would be a great idea for my entertainment. Upon installing one of the most well known apps, i wasn't only not being entertained by what I didnt wanted to see, but I was shocked to see that people were bashing one another for having different stances. Many people might think that the only ones opposing the BLM organization were white rich cis males however, youd be surprised that there were people of color going agaisnt the organiztions activist movements. I was not only sad to see that people would go to extreme lengths to “degrade” the opposing sides' ideas, but I was also upset to see the racism in the Twitter comments. </p><p>This racism was not mainly seen from the “white” people that many would. In contrast, it was seen from the side that was supporting the BLM organization. Comments such as “You cant talk because you're not a POC”, or “Shut up, you have white privilege and your opinion is invalid.” and “You're a traitor, you were just brainwashed by the white men”, were overtaking the app. It was a shame to see that people who were combatting racism were doing exactly that. They were downplaying people’s opinion who didn't agree with them on a political level or were simply not a POC.</p><p>It is for this reason, (and later to be found many more), that I wanted a change in how we ran society. Would we continue to kill each other over statements that we opposed, or would we come together in civility and have conversations that made western civilization what it is? Would we be able to sit across the table with a not-so-radical right leaning uncle, or with a not-so-radical left leaning sister in order to discuss and share ideas that can make America a great country? Would a kid be able to have a high position in school and be applauded if he had different political views than the majority? In my reasoning, I would say no. Not unless we find the roots of our ideas and are able to share them freely without being bashed and prosecuted for them. That's why Purposeful Purple was made. In order to awaken people and remind them that having different political views shouldn't stop you from accepting people into your life.</p>
