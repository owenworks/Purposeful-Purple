					<p>During my 8th grade year at Simpson Middle School, I had been attracting people by doing impressive scholarly moves. One of the most attention grabbing moments I did was running for Student Council President. I won the election, but it was followed by more people knowing my name, and myself being known as an accomplished individual. However, it was that same year that I noticed that politics had a big impact on people, no, not in a good way. When COVID hit and we were at the start of quarantine I made some discoveries that maybe I wasn't as stable in my self-identified political group as I thought I was. I made a switch that would consequently end my popularity. </p><p>During these times, the BLM movement was gaining momentum at a fast speed. It was also during these times that I decided Twitter would be a great idea for my entertainment. Upon installing one of the most well known apps, i wasn't only not being entertained by what I didnt wanted to see, but I was shocked to see that people were bashing one another for having different stances. Many people might think that the only ones opposing the BLM organization were white rich cis males however, youd be surprised that there were people of color going agaisnt the organiztions activist movements. I was not only sad to see that people would go to extreme lengths to “degrade” the opposing sides' ideas, but I was also upset to see the racism in the Twitter comments. </p><p>This racism was not mainly seen from the “white” people that many would. In contrast, it was seen from the side that was supporting the BLM organization. Comments such as “You cant talk because you're not a POC”, or “Shut up, you have white privilege and your opinion is invalid.” and “You're a traitor, you were just brainwashed by the white men”, were overtaking the app. It was a shame to see that people who were combatting racism were doing exactly that. They were downplaying people’s opinion who didn't agree with them on a political level or were simply not a POC.</p><p>It is for this reason, (and later to be found many more), that I wanted a change in how we ran society. Would we continue to kill each other over statements that we opposed, or would we come together in civility and have conversations that made western civilization what it is? Would we be able to sit across the table with a not-so-radical right leaning uncle, or with a not-so-radical left leaning sister in order to discuss and share ideas that can make America a great country? Would a kid be able to have a high position in school and be applauded if he had different political views than the majority? In my reasoning, I would say no. Not unless we find the roots of our ideas and are able to share them freely without being bashed and prosecuted for them. That's why Purposeful Purple was made. In order to awaken people and remind them that having different political views shouldn't stop you from accepting people into your life.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://spreadprivacy.com/content/images/2022/03/Cookie-Consent.v4.gif" class="kg-image" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1600" height="900"><figcaption>Tired of dealing with cookie consent pop-ups?

We're letting new people off the waitlist today, maybe even as you read this sentence, so the sooner you join, the sooner you'll get it. Please be patient with us though! We'll be inviting people in waves and improving the app as feedback comes in.</p><p>You won’t need to share any personal information to join. Instead, you’ll secure your place in line with a date and time that exists solely on your device, and we’ll notify you when we’re ready for you to join.</p><p>Here’s how you can join the private waitlist:</p><ol><li>Download the DuckDuckGo mobile app (or update to the latest version)</li><li>Open Settings &gt; DuckDuckGo for Desktop (in the "More from DuckDuckGo" section).</li><li>Click “Join the Private Waitlist.”</li><li>When you’re granted an invite code, you’ll get a notification from the app. The notification will take you to an invite code and a link to the download page to be opened on your desktop/laptop.</li></ol><p>Mac only please! Windows is coming -- <a href="https://twitter.com/duckduckgo" rel="noreferrer noopener">Follow us</a> on Twitter for updates.</p><p>If you try the new app, we’d love to hear from you! You can submit feedback and report issues by clicking on the settings menu in the top right corner of the window and selecting “Send Feedback”.</p><p><em>Note that during this beta period, DuckDuckGo for Mac is not available in the Mac App Store and is not to be confused with our DuckDuckGo Privacy Essentials Safari Extension that is currently available in the Mac App Store.</em></p><h2 id="beta-beyond">Beta &amp; Beyond.</h2><p>DuckDuckGo for Mac being in beta means that the experience is still evolving.</p><p>For example, you may notice we don't yet support extensions. Turns out the most popular extensions are password managers and those that protect you from creepy ads. So, we built these features right into our app, which has benefits for privacy, security, speed, and simplicity. &nbsp;We're working on how to provide additional extension functionality without compromising those critical elements, but in the meantime we’re confident our built-in features can meet your needs.</p><p><strong>Blocking Creepy Ads</strong></p><p>Our built-in tracker blocker isn’t a general “ad blocker”, but it does have the effect of blocking most creepy ads. Let me explain. Using our best-in-class <a href="https://github.com/duckduckgo/tracker-radar" rel="noreferrer noopener">tracker data set</a> we block invasive trackers, which then typically blocks the invasive ads themselves. In other words, if you use an ad blocker to avoid creepy ads and tracking, you should like DuckDuckGo for Mac.</p><p><strong>Password Manager</strong></p><p>Using a new browsing app doesn’t mean you have to lose your saved usernames and passwords. Our built-in password manager helps you import passwords from other browsers and browser extensions like 1Password or LastPass. We’re still in the process of building password management into our mobile apps and plan to offer private sync of passwords and bookmarks for a cohesive cross-device experience.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://spreadprivacy.com/content/images/2022/04/Logins--update-.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1600" height="900" srcset="https://spreadprivacy.com/content/images/size/w600/2022/04/Logins--update-.jpg 600w, https://spreadprivacy.com/content/images/size/w1000/2022/04/Logins--update-.jpg 1000w, https://spreadprivacy.com/content/images/2022/04/Logins--update-.jpg 1600w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>You can easily import your bookmarks and passwords from Safari, Edge, Chrome, Firefox, 1Password, and LastPass into our built-in secure password manager.</figcaption></figure><h2 id="protecting-your-privacy-really-is-that-simple">Protecting your privacy really is that simple.</h2><p>At DuckDuckGo our mission is to show the world that protecting privacy is simple. We know that in order to do this we must build apps that are a pleasure to use and provide as comprehensive privacy protection as possible, whether you're on your phone, at your desk, in a hammock, or somewhere else that is even nicer than a hammock, DuckDuckGo for Mac is a major step in this direction, and we thank you in advance for helping us make it even better!</p><hr><h2 id="if-you%E2%80%99re-still-reading-you-probably-want-a-peek-under-the-hood">If you’re still reading you probably want a peek under the hood!</h2><p>What makes DuckDuckGo for Mac unique is more than just what you see, it’s also how it is built. &nbsp;A traditional browser is made up of two parts: a rendering engine that translates web code into the websites you see, and then everything else that surrounds and supports that interface like bookmarks, tabs, settings, password management, tracker blocking, etc.</p><p>Over the past decade, the most common way new browsers have been developed is through a process known as “forking”. Developers copy (“fork”) a browser like Chrome (technically the project they fork is called Chromium) – and start with both the rendering engine and all the pieces that surround it. Then they build new stuff on top of it (and/or delete/change some of the Chromium code) to create the new browser.</p><p>DuckDuckGo for Mac does not fork Chromium (or anything else). Instead, we use the rendering engine that comes with macOS, which is created by Apple and the same rendering engine Safari uses. By building off the macOS rendering engine, our browser should also be most compatible with the Mac system (the same as Safari). Technically, we don’t have to “fork” any code to do this – we just call <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/webkit/wkwebview">an API</a> provided by macOS.</p><p>We are building everything else from scratch. So beyond rendering, all the code is ours – written by DuckDuckGo engineers with privacy, security, and simplicity front of mind. This means we don’t have the cruft and clutter that has accumulated in browsers over the years, both in code and design, giving you a modern look and feel and a faster speed. We plan to open source our Mac app after the beta period, like we’ve done for our <a href="https://github.com/duckduckgo/iOS" rel="noreferrer noopener">iOS</a> &amp; <a href="https://github.com/duckduckgo/Android" rel="noreferrer noopener">Android</a> app, and many of our built-in privacy protections are <a href="https://github.com/orgs/duckduckgo/repositories?type=all">already open sourced</a>.</p><p>We are taking a similar approach to Windows (more on that later this year). Ultimately, we’d love to support Linux as well, but we are focused on Mac and Windows for now. <a href="https://twitter.com/DuckDuckGo">Follow us on Twitter</a> if you'd like to stay up to date on our latest product announcements and how we're continuing to make "Privacy, simplified" a reality.</p><h2></h2>
